# IAD_Minor
Here are the projects that I have done during minor in Machine Learning and Data Science at the Faculty of Computer Science at HSE.

In the 1st semester: basics of python, not included here

In the 2nd semester: kNN method, linear regressions, gradient descent, text classification, trees, gradient boosting and clustering (DBSCAN) from scratch

In the 3rd semester: pytorch, neural networks, CNNs; image classification (resnet, inception, efficientnet, vit_b_32); YOLO model from scratch

In the 4th semester: generative neural networks (GANs, WGANs, diffusion models); encoder-decoder models for translation with attention layers, transformers; predicting time series with ETNA: Prophet, hierarchical, Catboost, ARIMA, ensembles
