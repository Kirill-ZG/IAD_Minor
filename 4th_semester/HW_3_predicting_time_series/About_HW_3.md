Here I used different methods to predict the amount of cash in ATM machines: using multi-segmented model on the base of Prophet; hierarchical time series; models based on data properties --- CatBoostMultiSegmentModel, CatBoostModelPerSegment, AutoARIMAModel, LinearPerSegmentModel and ensembles. Of course, heavy data analysis before using any of the methods mentioned before (exploratory data analysis)
